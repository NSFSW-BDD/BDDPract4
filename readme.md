# Practice 

The practice is designed to evaluate your implementation of an Express.js API with specific endpoints and functionality. The following instructions outline the expected behavior.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository**: Change to the repository's directory.

   ```shell
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command.

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. **Implement your Express.js application**: Create your Express.js application with the required endpoints and/or functionality based on the following specifications.

      **Basic Part 1**
      You are to work on the following in categoryModel.js
      
      1.insertCategory:
      This function is used to insert a new category into the category table.

      2.selectAll:
      This function retrieves all entries from the category table

      **Basic Part 2**
      You are to work on the following in furnitureModel.js

      1.selectById:
      This function retrieves a specific furniture from the furniture table based on its ID.

      2.selectByIdWithCategoryInfo:
      This function retrieves a specific furniture from the furniture table along with its corresponding category information.

5. **Submit your solution**:
   Once you finish testing your application, you can submit your solution for grading.

   Note: Make sure your Express.js application follows the specified endpoint URLs and handles requests and responses correctly according to the given instructions.
